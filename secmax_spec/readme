An idea arising from the Jack et al. [2015] paper where they analyse the NIR time series of 2014J (i-band) and pinpoint the cause of the second maximum as the FeII line at around 7500 A.


idea: look for Fe II line in the IR time series of the CSP sample. 

Kate's input: Understanding the plateau maybe a more interesting question (rightshe is)

--> Stephane sent an email about the Jack paper and what analysis could be done.
	* any spectral differences as a function of luminosity 
		would be interesting
	* finding lines less important than global properties eg. temperature and ionisation
