For the 5 highred SNe in the Ni masses paper I calculated the bolometric light curves using the reddening corrections given in the Burns+ 2014 paper
(Rv from multiband light curves)

The following are the comparison results:

SN		M(from bol)	M(from t2)
SN2006X		0.49		0.56
SN2005A 	0.49		0.56
SN2008fp	0.58		0.62
