tests for the nickel mass paper: What all has been done and checked

--> cross-checking values with those derived from the bolometric correction

--> using different linear slope evaluation methods (ODR, linfit with emcee, Kelly 2007 gibbs sampler).

--> comparing the different ways with which the Ni mass can be measured (Dm15, bolometric, Bmax )
