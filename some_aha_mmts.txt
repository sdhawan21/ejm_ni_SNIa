This file is a short text of incoherent observations on the Ni masses follow up paper. These are either for pre-emptive follow up question on the analyses or to catalog reasoning/textthat isn't suitable for the main body of the paper but still needs to be documented.

--also to prevent forgetfulness from getting the better of me ;)

1. The bolometric decline rates. In the current paper, the bolometric decline rates are a diagnostic for the internal structure of the ejecta. The fact that the m_{bol}|late is uniform (sigma=0.003, mu~0.03-0.028, depending on whether the 91bg likes are included or not)

However, the values published in Contardo '00 give a mean value of 2.6 mag/100days (+/- 0.2) which is inconsistent with the values 

Its because we use BVRIJH and not just BVRI 


2. thanks to the generosity of rahman amanullah, we have good late time J band data for 14J. Constraints on t2 of 1.15 days and an error on Ni mass of 0.12 M_Sun. 
the values are consistent with Churazov 2014.
(details in the main.pdf draft)

3. Distances/reddening estimation from this technique. If we believe the E(b-v) and R_v from Wang+2008, then we should get a distance measurement for M100 from the M_Ni (or Lbol, rather) of SN2006X

for our analysis, with an Mni of 0.58 (Lbol=1.16), A_V=2.1 +/- 0.14 and m_v of 14.11 (+/- 0.01) the distance to M100 is 31.36 (+/-) 0.34

--> looking at the distribution of calculated nickel masses. 
Deriving a B maximum from the value of Mni calculated will help understand whether the sample distribution has sensible values. 

Using richard's relation (Scalzo+2014c) the Mb distribution has a mean of -19.059 and an std of 0.34. For a sample of Ia''s without 91bg-likes or super-chandra explosions, this is the expected B-magnitude scatter (see Phillips 1993, Branch and Miller 93(?))
