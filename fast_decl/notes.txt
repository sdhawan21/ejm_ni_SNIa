Nickel mass values for 91bg like/ 86G like objects are in the ni_dm15.txt file

05bl value from Taubenberger et al. (they treat the missing passbands)

07mm doesnt have infrared or u band (extrapolated using the DDC models)

Strong correlation suggesting more Nickel implies later colour evolution, even within the 91bg-likes and the complete fast declining sample
