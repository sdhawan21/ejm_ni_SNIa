Flux redward of K contributes only a few % to the total bolometric flux

bluewards of u is a maximum contribution of ~6-10% (Suntzeff 1996, calculating the area under a blackbody with peak ard b-band)



table 2 and 6 have mni estimates for the sample of objects with low reddening and for the whole sample with t2 measured. 
the values in table 6 use a fixed rise-time mapping from Lbol to Mni. Comparing these values with column 5 of table 2, we can see a good agreement for all objects but 2005am. this object has a higher bolometric peak than its dm15 would predict. thus the expected mni from the best would be lower than the measured value.

1. errors on Mni from bolometric lc.
--> computed by MC
--> in case of fixed rise 19+/-3 days
--> in case of variable the error is +/-2 days (as in Scalzo 2014)

--> wang 2008 has a distribution of Ni masses derived from the delta m_15
their mean error is 0.17, attributed to a weaker correlation between the delta m_15 and mNi
Their sample relies heavily on the stritzinger+ papers to get the original calibration relation

#TOADD (when bruno is happy with the analysis section):

---> we use an orthogonal distance regression to obtain a best fit linear model to the data. (cite Boggs and Rogers)

--->	Describe the MCMC linear fit to the data using emcee (cite Foreman-Mackey)
