\begin{abstract}

The Near Infrared light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) present an interesting
trend at late phases. The SN in $i-K$ bands rebrightens at around $+15-+35$ days after $B$ maximum,
leading to a second maximum. Recent studies have shown that the timing of the second maximum 
is dependent on the intrinsic brightness of the SN, with brighter objects showing later maxima. 

Theoretical efforts to explain this phenomenon conclude that the second maximum is due to a flux redistribution
to longer wavelengths as a result of an ionization transition of iron group elements (mainly {$^{56} Co$} at these late times).
We investigate the possible relation between the amount of $^{56} Ni$ and the timing of the second maximum ($t_2$), for a sample of nearby objects
with low extinction from host galaxy dust.  

We also use the relation obtained to estimate the $^{56} Ni$ for highly reddened SN with NIR data available. We compare values from the empirical relation
to complementary methods where available (eg. $\gamma$ ray $Co$ observations for SN2014J). We propose that this relation can be used for highly reddened objects 
that are far away and do not have an accurate extinction measurement. It also provides a method of cross-validating measurements from the bolometric peak.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}


The uniformity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) has led to their use as
cosmological distance indicators \citep[reviewed in:][]{Branch1992,Leibundgut2000,Hillebrandt2000}.  As
cosmological probes the SNe\,Ia provided the first evidence for the
accelerated expansion of the universe
\citep{Riess1998,Perlmutter1999}.

Observations of large samples of SNe\,Ia %in optical and near-infrared 
show that the peak luminosity in the optical is not uniform
\citep[e.g.][]{Phillips1993, Riess1996, Guy2005, Guy2007, Guy2010,
Jha2007}, leading to different bolometric luminosities for the objects 
\citep{Contardo2000} implying variations in the physical
parameters of the explosion, in particular the synthesised nickel mass
and the total ejected mass \citep{Stritzinger2006, Scalzo2014}.  The
correlation at optical wavelengths between peak luminosity and light
curve shape together with the determination of the absorption towards
the supernova are the key ingredients of the calibration of these objects prior
to their use as distance indicators (\cite{Phillips1993}).

%citep[see][for the most recent evaluation of the available SNe\,Ia for
%cosmology]{Betoule2014}. 


At near infrared wavelengths SNeIa display a very uniform brightness
behaviour \citep{Elias1981, 
% this is a late time reference for IR light curves not directly relevant here.
%Elias1983, 
Meikle2000, K04a, K07}. The
scatter in the peak luminosity in these studies is  0.2
magnitudes, which, combined with the lower sensitivity of the IR to 
extinction by dust, has sparked increased interest in this wavelength
region. Statistically significant samples of SN~Ia light curves are thus becoming available
\citep{WV08, Contreras2010, Stritzinger2011, BN12} and have been used
to construct the first rest-frame near-infrared Hubble diagrams
\citep{Nobili2005,Freedman2009, Kattner2012, Weyant2014}. 

The light curve morphology in the infrared is markedly different from
that in the optical, with a pronounced secondary maximum in $IYJHK$
filters for 'normal' SNe\,Ia and a 'shoulder' in the $V$ and $R$ filter
light curves \citep{Elias1983, Leibundgut1988, Leibundgut2000,
Meikle2000, WV08, Folatelli2010}. \cite{Kasen2006} demonstrated that the
second maximum could be the result of decrease in opacity due to the
ionization change of Fe group elements from doubly to singly ionized
atoms, which preferentially radiate the energy at near-IR wavelengths.
He further indicated that larger iron mass would lead to a later maximum
in the IR light curves.

Recent studies have shown a strong dependence of the timing of the second maximum (hereafter $t_2$)
on the decline rate of the SNIa, indicating that brighter explosions have a later onset of the second maximum. A strong relation
between the $t_2$ and the onset of the uniform optical colour phase \citep[hereafter $t_L$, see also $t_{max}$][]{Burns2014} suggests that the second maximum is related to the colour evolution
which is tied to the amount of iron group elements synthesized in the explosion (\cite{Kasen2007}). The conclusion from these studies point to a connection between 
the $M_{^{56}Ni}$ in SNIa and $t_2$. 

In this study, we investigate ,directly, the link between the  $M_{^{56}Ni}$ and $t_2$. We use a sample of nearby objects with low extinction from dust, in order to circumvent uncertainties
from the specific reddening law used. We aim to use this relation to derive $M_{^{56}Ni}$ for heavily extinguished SNae where using the bolometric peak is extremely sensitive to the 
total absorption value used, and hence, the reddening law. To this end, we propose using NIR only data at late times along with an empirical relation to obtain precise 
estimates of $M_{^{56}Ni}$ for objects where other methods provide disparate results.

Dust extinction in the near-infrared is significantly reduced compared
to the optical leading to smaller corrections for dust and hence
decreased uncertainty introduced by these corrections. The optical dust
correction of SNe\,Ia is notoriously difficult and has led to large
discrepancies between individual supernovae and for complete samples. It
could even affect the light curve shapes for strongly reddened SNe\,Ia
\citep{Leibundgut1988, Amanullah2014}. Today, it remains unclear what
extinction law for the dust correction should be used \citep[see discussions in][]{Phillips2013, Scolnic2014} 
and this represents a major
uncertainty for the application of SNe\,Ia to cosmology
\citep[eg.][]{Peacock2006, Goobar2011}. The recent SN\,2014J is a case in
point with derived dust properties very different from local
interstellar dust \citep{Amanullah2014, Foley2014}. 




Studies of the $i$ band light curve find a relation between the phase
of the second maximum and the optical light curve shape 
\citep[e.g. $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, ][]{Folatelli2010, Hamuy1996}. The strength
of the second maximum in $i$ does not show such a correlation.

The properties of SNe\,Ia infrared light curves are investigated and
possible correlations with physical properties, e.g. nickel mass, are
established. The structure of this paper is as follows: after a
presentation of the input data in Section \ref{sec:data}, we analyse the
infrared light curve properties (Section~\ref{sec-LC}) along with a
description of IR colours. Correlations with optical light curve
parameters and their interpretations in section are given in
\S\ref{sec-corr} followed by a discussion in \S\ref{sec-disc}.

\section{Data} 
\label{sec:data}
%


The sample for this study is constrained by objects which have NIR observations at late times as well as well-sampled optical light curves to
construct a bolometric light curve. The main data source of
near-infrared photometry of SNe\,Ia currently comes from the Carnegie
Supernova Project \citep[CSP;][]{Contreras2010,Burns2011,Stritzinger2011,Phillips2012,Burns2014}.
They form an ideal basis for an evaluation of light curves parameters.

Since we aim to circumvent the uncertainties from host galaxy extinction, we only select objects with an $E(B-V)_host$+$E(B-V)_{MW}$ value
less than 0.2. Since we want to investigate the connection of $M_{Ni}$ with $t_2$ in the NIR, this excludes objects which are spectroscopically similar  
to the
peculiar SN~1991bg \citep{Filippenko1992, Leibundgut1993, Mazzali1997} and
objects that do not exhibit a second maximum
(SNe~2005bl, 2005ke, 2005ku, 2006bd, 2006mr, 2007N, 2007ax, SN2007ba,
2009F). On similar lines we exclude peculiar objects like 2006bt and 2006ot. 
%photometry from \citep{Meikle2000} and several SNe\,Ia observed by the European Supernova Consortium
%\citep[ESC;][]{Benetti2004, Pignata2008, ER06, Pastorello2007,
%Krisciunas2009}. The low-redshift CSP had a goal to
%provide an atlas of $\sim$100 SNe\,Ia with optical and infrared light
%curves in a homogeneous and well-defined photometric system. It relies 
%primarily on SN discoveries from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search
%citep[LOSS;][]{Leaman2011}. The CSP has published light curves on a
%otal of 82 SNe\,Ia of which 70 have photometry in $JHK$ bands. 


\iffalse
A summary of the 91~objects used in this work is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:sne_ref} where the phase range of observations
(first and last observation), total number of observations in each
filter and the reference for each data set are tabulated. Twelve of these SNe\,Ia
have been discussed by \citet{BN12} and have data only near the first
maximum. We also include IR photometry from two recent nearby
explosions, SN2011fe and SN2014J. The sample however, is dominated by objects
from the CSP. Hence, in section~\ref{sec-LC}, we divide the sample
into CSP and non-CSP objects. It is worth noting that there are 15 SNe\,Ia
with observed IR light curves beyond 100 days.

As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:sne_ref} and displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:lc1}the $K$ light curves are sparsely sampled  and
not enough objects are available for detailed analysis. We therefore 
disregard the $K$ light curves in the following as there is no
statistically significant sample available at this time.

In determining the  
% local
%JS: local is a strange word here 
minimum and second maximum, we required $\geq$4
observations at late phases ($>$7 days for the minimum and $>$15 days
for the second maximum) to constrain a spline fit. Only a subset
of the data could be used for the analysis at late times.

%indicated in the relevant sections.
